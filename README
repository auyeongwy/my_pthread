Reference code that demonstrates use of the pthreads. In this implementation, a parent spawns seveal workers which waits for input from the parent thread. The parent assigns work to the workers via a work queue system. The workers exit only after they receive an exit command from the parent thread.

To conmpile, just perform make.

To run,

my_pthread <no. of threads>
